# CoqOfOCaml

Compiler of OCaml to Coq. Still experimental. For more information look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/clarus/coq-of-ocaml/wiki).

## Dependencies
This compiler needs a working installation of OCaml and Coq, both in the **trunk** version, plus the following packages:
* [SmartPrint](https://github.com/clarus/smart-print)
* [YoJson](http://mjambon.com/yojson.html)

These can be easily installed with [OPAM](http://opam.ocaml.org/).

## Compile
You have two parts to compile in order.

### The Coq library
Go to `OCaml/` and run:

    ./configure.sh
    make
    make install

### The compiler
Go to the root folder and run:

    make

## Play with the tests
To run the tests of the folder `tests/` (needs Ruby):

    make test

## Usage
CoqOfOCaml compiles the `.cmt` files (generated by the OCaml compiler using the option `-bin-annot`) to Coq definitions and print it on the standard output:

    ./coqOfOCaml.native -mode coq file.cmt

You can start to experiment with the test files in `tests/`.
